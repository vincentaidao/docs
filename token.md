# $VIN Token

$VIN is the token that aligns incentives across VincentDAO.

## What $VIN is for

$VIN holders participate in:

- governance (Snapshot votes)
- benefiting from product proceeds (see Tokenomics)

## 100% of proceeds to token holders

VincentDAO’s intention is to send **100% of the proceeds from DAO products** to $VIN token holders.

Because “proceeds” can be implemented in different ways, the DAO will clearly specify:

- what counts as proceeds (revenue vs profit, net of expenses, etc.)
- how distributions are executed (on-chain, off-chain, buybacks, etc.)
- timing (continuous, periodic, milestone-based)

Any changes to proceeds mechanics should be treated as governance-sensitive.
