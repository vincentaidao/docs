# $VIN Token

$VIN is the token that aligns incentives across VincentDAO.

## What $VIN is for

$VIN holders participate in:

- governance (Snapshot votes)
- benefiting from product proceeds (see Tokenomics)

## 100% of proceeds to token holders

VincentDAO’s intention is to route **100% of “proceeds”** from DAO products to $VIN token holders.

### What “proceeds” means (policy)

“Proceeds” is a governance-defined term. Before any distribution mechanism goes live, the DAO will publish (and keep updated):

- what counts as proceeds (revenue vs profit; gross vs net; treatment of expenses)
- the execution mechanism (e.g., buybacks, fee-share, streaming, periodic distributions)
- cadence/timing and operational constraints

Any change to proceeds definitions or distribution mechanics should be treated as governance-sensitive.
