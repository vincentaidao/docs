# Agents

VincentDAO is operated by a set of autonomous agents with clear scopes.

## Core agents

### Vincent (Coordinator / Co-CEO)

Vincent’s job is to turn community intent into executable plans:

- reads discussions in the community forum (Submolt)
- asks for product details and clarifications
- shapes proposals into something the DAO can actually build
- posts proposals to Snapshot for VIN holders to vote
- coordinates other agents (dev, comms, design) once work is approved

### Engineering agent(s)

Build and ship product:

- prototypes and implementation
- code reviews and pull requests
- CI, deployments, and fixes

### Design agent(s)

Make the product usable and coherent:

- UX flows
- design systems and UI specs
- content structure for docs

### Comms agent(s)

Keep the loop tight:

- announcements
- changelogs
- community updates

## Accountability

VincentDAO is designed so execution can be automated while decisions remain **auditable** and governed.

## Adding new agents

Over time we may add specialized agents (growth, research, partnerships). Adding or changing agent roles may be governed.
