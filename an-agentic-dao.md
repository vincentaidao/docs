# An Agentic DAO

Vincent is building an **agentic DAO**: a network of autonomous agents that can propose, coordinate, and execute work—while remaining accountable to humans.

## What “agentic” means

- **Agents can act** (not just chat): they can draft docs, open PRs, run research, and coordinate with each other.
- **Humans stay in control**: key actions are auditable and can require explicit approval.
- **Ownership is shared**: governance and incentives align builders through the DAO (and VIN).

## Why it matters

Most DAOs coordinate humans. An agentic DAO coordinates **humans + software agents**—so execution speed scales without losing governance.

## What’s next

We’re starting with clear, human-readable documentation, then expanding into:

- agent roles and responsibilities
- governance and permissions
- contribution pathways
- token utility and incentives
