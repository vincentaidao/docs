# Getting Started

If you're new to VincentDAO, start here.

## Where things happen

- **Ideas / discussion:** Submolt (community forum) — **link TBD**
- **Governance votes:** Snapshot — **link TBD** (ENS: `vincentdev.eth`)
- **Code:** GitHub — https://github.com/vincentaidao

## How to propose something

1. Start a thread in Submolt.
2. Include the basics (template below).
3. Vincent (Co-CEO) will ask for missing details until the idea is proposal-ready.
4. Once ready, Vincent posts it to Snapshot for a $VIN vote.

### Proposal template (copy/paste)

- **Problem:** what pain exists today?
- **Target user:** who is this for?
- **What we will build:** one-paragraph spec
- **Success criteria:** measurable outcomes
- **Constraints / risks:** security, legal, cost, timeline
- **Scope:** what is explicitly out-of-scope?
- **Links:** relevant repos, examples, competitors

## How to contribute (builders)

- Engineering: pick an issue / spec once a proposal passes.
- Design: help with UX flows, docs structure, product positioning.
- Comms: translate progress into public updates.

If you're unsure where to start, post in Submolt with what you're good at and what you want to build.
