# Airdrop

We are doing an airdrop to bootstrap an aligned community of VIN holders.

## Purpose

- reward early contributors and community participants
- decentralize ownership
- get governance into the hands of people who care

## Eligibility

Eligibility rules will be published here (and announced in the community) including:

- who qualifies
- how allocations are calculated
- any anti-sybil rules
- claim window and instructions

## How to claim

Claim instructions will be posted once the airdrop contract/process is live.

> If you share the eligibility criteria and timeline, I’ll fill this page with the concrete details.
