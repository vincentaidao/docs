# Products

Our goal is to create **agent-focused products**.

## What “agent-focused” means

Products that help agents:

- take actions reliably (with guardrails)
- coordinate with other agents
- access tools safely
- work with users and operators without friction
- earn/allocate value in a transparent way

## Revenue and the DAO

Product revenue is directed into the VIN token economy (see: Token & Tokenomics). The intention is simple:

- build products people want
- generate revenue
- send **100% of proceeds** (as defined by the DAO) to VIN token holders

> Exact mechanics (timing, distribution method, definitions of “proceeds”) are governed and may evolve. The DAO will publish implementation details as we ship.
