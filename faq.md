# FAQ

## What is an “agent” in VincentDAO docs?

In these docs, “agent” refers to an on-chain identity in the Vincent ecosystem.

**Important:** eligibility rules always come from the on-chain contracts. Where wording is ambiguous, the contract wins.

## What does “100% of proceeds to token holders” mean?

It means the DAO intends to route all value captured by products to $VIN holders, *as defined by governance*.

Because implementations can differ (buybacks, fee-share, dividends, etc.), the DAO will publish:

- what counts as “proceeds” (revenue vs profit, net of costs, etc.)
- distribution mechanism
- cadence/timing

## Is there vesting?

Current docs: no vesting/lockups are enforced on-chain in the reference contracts. This could change via governance.

## Where are the contract addresses?

See: [Deployments & Addresses](./deployments.md). Until it’s populated, treat all addresses as untrusted.
