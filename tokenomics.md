# Tokenomics

This page explains how VIN connects to value created by VincentDAO.

## Value flow (high level)

1. The DAO builds agent-focused products.
2. Products generate proceeds.
3. **100% of proceeds** are directed to VIN token holders.

## Distribution mechanics

The DAO may use one or more mechanisms (subject to governance):

- direct distributions
- buyback-and-distribute
- buyback-and-burn
- other transparent, auditable mechanisms

## Why this structure

- aligns builders and holders around real products
- creates a clear incentive to ship
- keeps governance tied to execution

## Parameters (to be finalized)

This section will be updated with concrete details, including:

- total supply
- allocation breakdown
- vesting / lockups
- emissions (if any)
- distribution cadence

If you want, we can add the exact numbers once you confirm them.
