# Tokenomics

This page documents the $VIN tokenomics for **Ethereum mainnet**.

## Total supply

- **Total supply:** **1,000,000,000 $VIN**

## Allocation

| Bucket | Amount | % |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| Token sale (sold to participants) | 300,000,000 VIN | 30% |
| Liquidity seeding (VIN reserved for the Uniswap LP) | 150,000,000 VIN | 15% |
| DAO / Treasury (VIN) | 335,000,000 VIN | 33.5% |
| Agent Stimmy Drop (airdrop) | 115,000,000 VIN | 11.5% |
| Human / Founder allocation | 100,000,000 VIN | 10% |

Notes:
- The LP VIN reserve exists so the pool can be seeded at the **same price as the sale** while only allocating a portion of sale ETH to liquidity.

## Proceeds to token holders

VincentDAO intends to route **100% of product proceeds** to $VIN token holders.

“Proceeds” is governance-defined. Implementation details (definitions, distribution method, cadence) may evolve via governance; this doc will be updated as mechanisms are finalized.

## Vesting / lockups

- **No vesting/lockups are enforced on-chain** in the current contracts.
